# Odin Library Project

I am using the concepts of objects and object constructors to create a simple personal library system.

## Notes for myself

- Get the amount of pages the user is reading so far and calculate the percentage of the book they have read based on given max pages. Output the result using an animated circle progress bar.
- Fix grid problem in the book info container (May need to fix the grid layout)
